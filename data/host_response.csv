Additional information: a) We don't actually know the infective dose. What is provided is the titer of the mosquito, not the dose the mosquito inoculated whilst blood feeding. b) Peak titer has been converted to per mL (it was originally per 100 uL). The SD values will have to be changed to reflect this (i.e. should be 2.6 CCID50/mL). c) Still not sure where they got the peak viremia titre they cite in the text..."

As far as I can make out it is 3.3 LOG/mL of viraemia. They state that viraemia never went above this titre. The duration of viramia differed between sheep with a maximum duration of 5 days. So, you'll need to recalculate the values."

This is not really a peak viraemia, It is the limit of detection of the assay (which is 3.2 LOG TCID50/mL). So, using the virus content of a blood fed mosquito as a way to measure viraemia showed that all were negative (i.e. titres less than 3.2 LOG TCID50/mL), but we don't know what their titres were, even if they had a low level viraemia."
